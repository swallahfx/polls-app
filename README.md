## Building Web Applications

### For Context

We want to learn how to create robust web applications using Django(a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design) along with Continuous Integration(the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project). You are to focus on learning and understanding the following

- Creating web applications with Django
- Use PostgreSQL as Django Database backend
- Setting up continuous integration using Github Actions

### Expectations

By the end of the tasks, you should be able to have an in-depth understanding of the concept and implementations of the following

1. Django components and how they fit together to form a whole:
      - Models
      - Views
      - URLs in Django
      - Request and Response Cycle
      - Django Template engine

2. Continuous Integration
      - Testing Django applications
      - Setting up continuous integration using Github actions

## Part I → Polls App

In this part, you are to follow Django official documentation tutorial to create polls app. This tutorial comprises of 7 parts with each part explaining a concept or component of Django project. [Polls App Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial01/)

**Note: Make sure you deeply conceptualize, comprehend and understand the current part before moving on to the next.**

### Setup

- Clone this repository from Github classroom
- You will find it only contains a README file and a .gitignore file.
- Create and checkout to a new git branch called `setup_ci`. And in this branch …
- Create a .github folder. In this folder …
- Create PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md file and add PR format of your choice.
- Create a workflow folder and add `ci.yml` file and implement configuration for continuous integration
- Make a commit for your changes in the setup_ci branch and push the branch to your repository
- Visit the repository on Github and create a pull request from the branch and merge it to master or main branch
- Go back to GIT and checkout to master and pull the merged changes into your local master.
- So you start the cycle again for each part of the tutorial and name each branch the topic treated in the part.

## Part II → Create a Portfolio Web Application

In this part, you are to create a portfolio web application for yourself. A portfolio website provides professional information about an individual or a company and presents a showcase of their work.

### Approach

You are expected to complete this project using the following approach

- Create a personal GitHub repository for this application
- Make sure you write a proper and understandable readme describing what the application is all about and how the application can be run locally (Getting started)
- You may or may not follow the [Udemy Course] Create a web application with python + Django + PostgreSQL: Section 1 & 2
- Make sure you put both your frontend and backend skills into usage and build a unique, attractive and smashing web application that you will be proud of, after all, it’s your portfolio website.
- When you are done with your implementation add the GitHub link to `part 1` readme file.
- [OPTIONAL] Host the web application on any hosting platform of your choice (Heroku, Pythonanywhere, Digital Ocean, AWS etc) and add the link to `part 1` readme file
